Design Document for Connect 4

Project Layout: 
    The program starts by displaying a menu with three options: Play Game, Load Game, and Exit.
    If the user chooses to play a game:
    a. They are prompted to enter their name and their opponent's name.
    b. The game begins with an empty Connect 4 board displayed.
    c. Players take turns making moves by entering a column number (1-7) where they want to drop their piece. They can also choose to save and quit by entering 0.
    d. After each move, the board is displayed, and the program checks for a win or tie condition.
    e. If a win or tie is detected, the game ends, and the user is returned to the main menu.
    If the user chooses to load a game:
    a. The program loads the saved game from the "saved_game.txt" file.
    b. The game resumes from where it was saved, and players continue making moves as described above.
    c. After the game ends, the user is returned to the main menu.
    If the user chooses to exit the program:
    a. The program displays a goodbye message and terminates.
